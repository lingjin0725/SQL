# University Enrollment Database Using SQL

This project was developed as part of the DATA 324: Data Repository Systems course. It simulates a university's academic record system using a relational database built with SQL.

## 📁 Project Overview

The database includes multiple normalized tables that model students, courses, enrollments, prerequisites, and academic tracks. SQL queries were written to answer complex questions about student progress and course requirements.

## 🛠️ Features

- Created and normalized schema (1NF to 3NF) for academic data.
- Implemented tables with constraints and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity.
- Wrote advanced SQL queries including:
  - Multi-table joins
  - Subqueries and nested SELECTs
  - Aggregations and GROUP BY logic
  - Filtering and sorting for student performance analysis

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with database normalization and SQL query logic
- Practice designing relational schemas and executing real-world queries
- Understanding of data integrity and constraint enforcement in SQL
